For this assignment we have created a GitHub repository containing two files: pie-chart.html and the present one (readme.md).

The first file, using the javascript library d3.js, contains a pie-chart drawn by taking data from an 'input' tag. We first set an array of values to draw the chart. These values are interactive and can be altered through the HTML outputpage. Note that these values are no percentages, so they need not add to 100. When a value is altered, is proportion is calculated and displayed in the chart.
